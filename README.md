# lro
specs for mods in the lro namespace.

these are mods that originated from [LROverhaul](https://github.com/LunaKampling/LROverhaul). note that inclusion in this namespace doesn't imply the feature is originally from LRO, but rather that the spec was created for use of the feature with LRO's lrb writer, and it didn't belong in common.

these exist mainly for compatibility with .trk files
